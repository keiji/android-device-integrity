# OWASP Session Management Compliance Check Report

This document outlines how the recent changes to the Play Integrity API service address the security concerns raised in the issue, specifically in relation to the OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet.

## Session ID Generation

The new `classic/v2/nonce` endpoint generates a UUIDv4 `session_id`. This is a significant improvement over the previous implementation, which required the client to provide a `session_id`. By generating the `session_id` on the server, we can ensure that it is unique and unpredictable, which is a key requirement of the OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet.

## Nonce Generation

The new endpoint also generates a 24-byte random nonce. This nonce is used to prevent replay attacks, which is another key requirement of the OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet.

## Session ID Storage

The `session_id` and `nonce` are stored in the datastore. This ensures that they are not lost if the server is restarted.

## Session ID Collision

The new endpoint retries up to 8 times if a `session_id` collision occurs. This is a rare event, but it is important to handle it gracefully to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

## Conclusion

The changes made in this task address the security concerns raised in the issue and bring the Play Integrity API service into compliance with the OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet.
