# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are applied to
# any library consumer propagating R8 testing.
#
# Add rules to suppress R8 warnings, keep classes or members.
# See https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#keep-code
#
# For example, to keep all classes in an annotation:
# -keep @com.example.CustomAnnotation class *
#
# Or to keep all public methods in a class:
# -keep public class com.example.LibraryClass {
#    public *;
# }
